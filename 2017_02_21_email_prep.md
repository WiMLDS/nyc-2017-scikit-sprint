Preparation

1.  Read through the [16 pages of Scikit-learn Contributing Documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html)

2.  There are over 750 open issues.  For the sprint, we'll be focusing on those which are labeled "easy" and "Need Contributor".  Take some time (15-20 minutes) to look over some of these issues prior to the event:  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AEasy

Bring your business cards.  We have some t-shirts from the upcoming MLConf that we'll be raffling.  (18% Early Bird Registration Here Ends Feb 28)
